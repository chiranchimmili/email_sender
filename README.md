# email_sender

Mass email sender that I used for my job as an administrative medical assistant at Winderemere Medical Group.
From an excel sheet with eligible emails, the program sends emails to everyone on the list at once.
I used this to send emails to patients to notify them that they were eligible for the vaccine. 


Most helpful for elderly patients who did not receive/not responding to text messages from the clinic. 
Also useful for non-patients, who signed up to recieve eligibility emails through google forms.
Email contains subject, content, and embedded image (banner). Emails can be sent from gmail, outlook, hotmail, and yahoo addresses (used outlook).
